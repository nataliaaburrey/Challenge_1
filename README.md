Challenge 1.

1. Introduction 
2. What containes
3. How to use
4. Answers
5. Technologies used (libraries & versions)
6. Acknowledgments (hours spent, helps recruiters)

1. This code was written by Natalia Burrey to use and summurise new skills i learned in Module 1 during the first week of Berkeley Fintech Bootcamp 

2. File (loan_analyzer.py) is an original file for Challenge 1 with a code I wrote.  (inexpensive_loans.csv) is the CSV file, a spreadsheet being created after you run the code (specifically Part 5 of the Challenge 1) in the Termilal.

3. You can run this code through Terminal on MacOS or other similar program for other operational systems. 


4. By running this code you get following results:

The number of loans is 5
The total value of the loans is 2750
The average loan amount from the list is 550.0
Future value of the loan is 1000
The number of Remaining Months is 9
Present Value= 861.7727126032183
The loan is too expensive and not worth the price
The present value of the loan is $: 820.08.
[{‘loan_price’: 500, ‘remaining_months’: 13, ‘repayment_interval’: ‘bullet’, ‘future_value’: 1000}, {‘loan_price’: 200, ‘remaining_months’: 16, ‘repayment_interval’: ‘bullet’, ‘future_value’: 1000}] 

5. I used Visual Studio Code to modified the original task file. I used Terminal to run the code and later to create repository,upload and modified files on GitHub. Conda (dev) inviroment was activated and Path from a pathlib libriry for CSV files was downloaded. 


6. I spent about 5 hours to complete the task + 4 hours with TA members (2+2) Seige and Joel during assigned hours via zoom
I created study group channel with John Richardson, Nestor Ramirez and Violet on Slack where we were able to exchange ideas and share some thoughts about code.
